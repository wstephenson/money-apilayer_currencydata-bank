A gem that calculates the exchange rate using published rates from
[apilayer.com](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/currency_data-api)

Forked from [phlegx/money-currencylayer-bank](https://github.com/phlegx/money-currencylayer-bank) because

## Reason for fork

currencylayer.com is no longer signing up new accounts, and is redirecting to apilayer.com instead.
The Apilayer Currency Data API is largely the same as the currencylayer API used by the upstream gem.

## Differences to `money-currencylayer-bank`
- apilayer.com APIs take an `apikey` header rather than a parameter
- Apilayer CurrencyData allows other source currencies than USD for free accounts, removing the need for cross conversion
- `terms` and `privacy` fields are no longer sent in the response

## Currency data API

~~~ json
{
  "timestamp": 1441101909,
  "source": "USD",
  "quotes": {
      /* 168 currencies */
      "USDAUD": 1.413637,
      "USDCAD": 1.316495,
      "USDCHF": 0.96355,
      "USDEUR": 0.888466,
      "USDBTC": 0.004322, /* Includes Bitcoin currency! */
      ...
      }
}
~~~


## Features

* supports 168 currencies
* includes [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) virtual currency
* precision of rates up to 6 digits after point
* uses fast and reliable json api
* average response time < 20ms
* supports caching currency rates
* calculates every pair rate calculating inverse rate or using base currency rate
* supports multiple server instances, thread safe

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'money-apilayer_currencydata-bank'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install money-apilayer_currencydata-bank

## Usage

~~~ ruby
# Minimal requirements.
require 'money/bank/apilayer_currencydata_bank'
mclb = Money::Bank::ApilayerCurrencyBank.new
mclb.access_key = 'your access_key from https://apilayer.com/account'

# (optional)
# Set the base currency for all rates. By default, USD is used.
# CurrencylayerBank only allows USD as base currency for the free plan users.
mclb.source = 'EUR'

# (optional)
# Set the seconds after than the current rates are automatically expired.
# By default, they never expire, in this example 1 day.
mclb.ttl_in_seconds = 86400

# (optional)
# Use https to fetch rates from CurrencylayerBank.
# CurrencylayerBank only allows http as connection for the free plan users.
mclb.secure_connection = true

# Define cache (string or pathname).
mclb.cache = 'path/to/file/cache'

# Update rates (get new rates from remote if expired or access rates from cache).
# Be sure to define the cache first before updating the rates.
mclb.update_rates

# Force update rates from remote and store in cache.
# Be sure to define the cache first before updating the rates.
# mclb.update_rates(true)

# Set money rounding mode.
Money.rounding_mode = BigDecimal::ROUND_HALF_EVEN

# Set money default bank to ApiLayer Currence Data bank.
Money.default_bank = mclb
~~~

### More methods

~~~ ruby
mclb = Money::Bank::ApilayerCurrencyBank.new

# Returns the base currency set for all rates.
mclb.source

# Expires rates if the expiration time is reached.
mclb.expire_rates!

# Returns true if the expiration time is reached.
mclb.expired?

# Get the API source url.
mclb.source_url

# Get the rates timestamp of the last API request.
mclb.rates_timestamp

# Get the rates timestamp of loaded rates in memory.
moxb.rates_mem_timestamp
~~~

### How to exchange

~~~ ruby
# Exchange 1000 cents (10.0 USD) to EUR
Money.new(1000, 'USD').exchange_to('EUR')        # => #<Money fractional:89 currency:EUR>
Money.new(1000, 'USD').exchange_to('EUR').to_f   # => 8.9

# Format
Money.new(1000, 'USD').exchange_to('EUR').format # => â‚¬8.90

# Get the rate
Money.default_bank.get_rate('USD', 'CAD')        # => 0.9

### Using gem money-rails

You can also use it in Rails with the gem [money-rails](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money-rails).

~~~ ruby
require 'money/bank/apilayer_currencydata_bank'

MoneyRails.configure do |config|
  mclb = Money::Bank::ApilayerCurrencyBank.new
  mclb.access_key = 'your access_key from https://apilayer.com/account'
  mclb.update_rates

  config.default_bank = mclb
end
~~~

### Cache

You can also provide a Proc as a cache to provide your own caching mechanism
perhaps with Redis or just a thread safe `Hash` (global). For example:

~~~ ruby
mclb.cache = Proc.new do |v|
  key = 'money:apilayer_currencybank'
  if v
    Thread.current[key] = v
  else
    Thread.current[key]
  end
end
~~~

## Process

The gem fetches all rates in a cache with USD as base currency. It's possible to compute the rate between any of the currencies by calculating a pair rate using base USD rate.

## Tests

You can place your own key on a file or environment
variable named TEST_ACCESS_KEY and then run:

~~~
bundle exec rake
~~~
